Hack the Termlink Terminal

This game is inspired by the fallout terminal and plays the same way.
There is a link below that shows the original and how it works.

Game Objective:

Find the password out of the given words. The password is dynamically
chosen each game. Each wrong answer will tell you which letters are
correct. This means the letter and it's position within the word is
correct. There are secret bugs within the code, if you find them you
will be rewarded by removing a false answer. You have 4 tries before
the terminal locks down to find the answer. After this happens you
will have to restart (refresh the page).
