# Portfolio

I started this project with the desire to make a portfolio website that doesn't just
send you to a github but show you that I can program and make something. I know no one
wants to clone projects endlessly or read endless readmes. I found inspiration in the
fallout terminal ( link below ) and thought it was a good idea to improve my front-end
skills especially my javascript since I knew that was a skill in demand. I also wanted
to learn sass/scss and this gave me an opportunity to do so.

Soon after starting I realized that a few others have done this before. I looked at what
& how they completed it themselves but I resisted reading their code as much as I could.
I wanted to learn and struggle on my own.

There were a lot of aspects I found challenging through this project. All the animations
were very difficult to get exactly right. I had looked how others did it but again I really
wanted to learn this for myself so I made sure to take the concept but remake it myself.
I also wanted this project to work on all screens regardless of size. I tried my best to
make this as responsive as possible. I also wanted to add sounds since it adds another
dimension to the game.
